"""
agent.py - YOUR poker bot. This one file is a complete web server.

Run it:
    python agent.py                  # listens on port 5008
    PORT=5010 python agent.py        # or pick a port

Play a match against a baseline (three windows):
    python agent.py                                 # your bot on port 5008
    python baseline-bots/baseline_random.py         # opponent on port 5009
    python judge_engine.py                          # judge: both halves (uses those two ports)

Check that the tournament can run it:
    python -m pytest -q              # tests in test_agent.py
    ./tools/check_build.sh           # builds and smoke-tests it like the tournament

TODO:
    1. Assign your agent a unique PARTICIPANT and AGENT_NAME below.
    2. Implement the three functions between "YOUR CODE HERE" and "END OF YOUR CODE".

Everything under "SERVER PLUMBING" talks to the judge. You normally never
need to change it, and if you break it the judge can't talk to your bot.

#   POST /act        -> the judge sends any finished hands plus an Observation;
